"Hi Whitney,We are wrapping up the last parts of the audiobook now. When uploading the audiobook on Amazon you need to provide a retail sample as well. This is the sample potential buyers can listen to in order to decide if they want to purchase the book. The sample should be shorter then 5 minutes.Do you have any part of the book in mind that you want to be used for the retail sample?Justin","Hi Justin,I don't have a specific portion in mind for the retail sample. Maybe chapter 2? Do you have any suggestions? I'm excited about getting the full audiobook! Would it be possible to also book with y'all for book 2? I have that one all written. Book 3 releases Monday, January 15th, and book 4 (the final of the series) releases May 15th of this year. I'd love to have these two narrators do the entire 4 book series if that's possible.WhitneyWhitney's Book Works"
"Hi Whitney,Have you received my previous email containing the contract?If you have received it, how does it look?  Do you have any questions or suggested changes to the contract?Best regards,Justin Schiltman",Hi!I'm sorry for my delayed response. I'd had someone looking over the contract for me. I didn't see any issues and am looking to move forward with it all.WhitneyWhitney's Book Works
"We will start with the first book and when everything goes well we will continue with the rest of the series. We can publish the audiobook on amazon.com, audible and iTunes. Would you like us to make a custom sample for you?","I have considered that. Would it be just the one book or could we do more like this? Also, what platforms would it be available?"
"Hi Nola,Thank you for your quick response. I understand completely. I am able to get a female voice actor with a higher tone of voice but I won't be able to get any voice actors without this accent. Let me know if you want me to send a sample of this other female voice actor or if the accent is a complete dealbreaker for you.","I know beggars shouldn't be choosers. ?? But if/whe. I ever get this done, I want it to be perfect, and since I'm never overly impressed with even the biggest names in narration, i just really want them to match what's in my head. I'm sorry. ??"
"Hi Praise,Thank you so much. I have approved the payment.We are also very excited for the audiobook to launch!","Hi Justin, Perfect!! All done. Congratulations to you and your team! I have approved in ACX just waiting for your approval. Incredible job, and I can't wait for it to go on sale.Praise"
"Hi Kaci,Thank you for your response.The lack of sales could be because this was your first audiobook. The audiobooks need, just like the ebook, some time to build a fanbase. I can imagine you wouldn't want to risk another investment after this experience. Would you be interested in doing a royalty share agreement with us? That would mean you don't need to invest anything yourself. Once the audiobook is published we will share all royalties 50-50.Best regards,Justin SchiltmanZim Recordings","Hi Justin,Im excited about making more audiobooks at some point. However, Christmas in Dixie was produced at $150/hour professionally, I hold all the rights, and I still have not made back the cost (in 18 months time!).Although I have some readers asking me to make more audiobooks, the reality is my income breakdown is about 70 percent ebook and 25 percent paperback at this time.Im glad you enjoyed my book.

That's great to hear. I took the liberty to create some custom samples for your. You can find them attached to this email.  These voice actors have done dual narration before. So that should be no problem. Let me know what you think about the samples.,"That sounds amazing. What examples can you show me? I would love to have all my books made to audio, but they're dual POV and those books just don't hit the same without dual actors."
"Hi Kaci,Thank you for your quick response. The outdoor store owners are called Macon and Ronald. We offer a complete production package, so that includes narrating, editing and mastering. For this we ask a standard rate of 200 USD per hour of finished audiobook. For example, a book of 70,000 would be on average 7.5 hours which would cost a total of 7.5*$200 = $1,500. What we are offering through this campaign is a 50% discount, which would bring the amount of the example book down to $750. How does that sound?Best regards,Justin SchiltmanZim Recordings"," Hi Justin, I would need more details concerning price, etc. To make sure this isn't a scam and you actually read my book, what are the names of the two outdoor store owners?Thanks,Kaci"
"Hi Nola,I understand the situation. However, I think there is a great opportunity here. I would really love for you to work with our studio. In order to get around the financial hurdle, let me offer you an alternative. We will take care of all narration and production costs and in return we can split the royalties made on audiobook sales 50-50.How does that sound?Best regards,Justin SchiltmanZim Recordings","If I could afford it, I would love that. For all my books, but I can't afford it atm."

"Hi Praise,We have already finished all records and are now just editing the last few chapters.The narrator liked the section of chapter 3 where the village gets raided. I have uploaded this as the retail sample. if you prefer a different section you can let us know and we can easily change it.We have also already recorded all the sections at the end of the book except the glossary. Do you want us to include those or rather keep them out?"," Hi Justin, Sorry for the late response; I am on call this week, and it's insane. I am very excited yall are finishing up. Attached is the final version; if you have already finished recording, don't worry about it, but if you have not finished recording, use this final version to start where she left off to complete the reading.Do you have a suggestion of what to put for the 5-minute section? I don't really have a preference.Also, there is no need to read the glossary, get in touch, or come up next. You can just read the author bio and add the narrator bio.Praise"

Would it then maybe be smart to make a new shared account with the narrator so that we can both see the sales and profits or what methods would you recommend I use such that I am able to go forward with a royalty-sharing agreement but can also use findaway voices?

You can rest assured that you'll receive vast personalized attention and opportunities for feedback, allowing you to contribute your insights to the project. We encourage you to engage as much as you'd like since, ultimately, it's your book.Our confidence in the quality we deliver is such that we request payment only once the entire project is completed to your satisfaction.To give you a better idea about how we operate, here’s a quick rundown of our process:1.????Sample Texts: Share some text samples and any specific requests you have for the narrators e.g., male or female, accent, reading style.2.????Narrator Samples: Once we get that, we'll have our narrators record some demos for you. Normally in around a week, you’ll have these samples, along with some info on each narrator.3.????Your Pick: Give them a listen. If none strike the right chord, no worries! We'll send over more until you find that perfect voice.4.????Production Time: After you've made your choice, send over the eBook. We handle all the recording and editing right here. You can expect regular updates and opportunities for feedback. Generally, it takes about a month, but it depends on the book's length.5.????Final Review: You'll get the completed audiobook for a last look. Need any tweaks? We're on it. When you are satisfied with the result, you can launch it on Audible or other platforms.6.????Payment: Only after your audiobook is live and on sale do you pay us.7.????Promotion: Post-launch, we will help you with promotion to ensure your audiobook is as big a hit as the eBook.How does that sound?Best regards,Justin Schiltman","Thank you for reaching out!

"Hello Lisa, Thank you for your swift response. We're delighted to hear about your ongoing audiobook production efforts. Based on our experience, audiobooks have proven successful not only for new releases but also for revitalizing older titles. Converting your established books into audiobook format can yield substantial rewards. Based on our experience, this transition frequently brings about significant accomplishments within the audiobook realm.The audiobook market, complementing rather than competing with the Kindle market, holds the potential to bolster your sales in both avenues. I've also noticed the impressive success of your ""The Magelands Epic"" series. Given its Kindle success, an audiobook adaptation not only promises strong sales but also the prospect of elevating your Kindle readership.We are genuinely enthusiastic about this prospect and are even prepared to engage under a royalty-sharing arrangement.Your thoughts on this proposal would be greatly appreciated.Best regards,Justin Schiltman",Hello Justin Thanks for getting in touch but we already have someone recording this series.Kind regardsLisa (on behalf of) Christopher Mitchell

"Hello Imani, Below in this email, I've attached sample recordings of three different narrators we currently have available.Please share your thoughts on these samples and indicate which voice resonates with you the most. Consider sending us a brief excerpt from one of your books. This will allow us to create a tailored sample for you, giving you an idea of what your Audiobook might come to sound like.Best regards,Justin Schiltman"," Hi, do you have any samples I can hear, please?"

The first book of the series, Link'd Up, has already been turned into audio. It's a dual narration, since these books are written in 2 first-person POV perspectives. Please let me know what the process is if I decide to go forward with this. Thank you! Amanda WashingtonWriting as Harley Stone"
"Hello Angela, I hope this email addresses all your questions and concerns accordingly.My name is Tinashe. I am a narrator working for Zim Recordings, a recording studio owned by Justin & Robin Schiltman. The email address I am using to contact you now is the studio's official email. You can always reach out to me on this email, and I will personally attend to your messages.Regarding the sample I sent yesterday, I created new samples since I wanted to showcase my ability to experiment with different voices. If you prefer a particular voice, such as the first one I used for Triad, I am more than happy to continue with that style. Any other notes or preferences you have for the voices I did or will do, I will gladly incorporate them as well.Regarding the pace of narration, I will gladly adjust to your preference for a slightly higher pace if that's what you desire.Thank you for sharing the E-Book with me. However, when I attempted to accept it, I encountered an issue where it requires me to be located in the same county/region. Consequently, I am unable to accept and read the E-Book. Is there an alternative method for you to share the E-Book with me?As for payment, our minimum rate is 50 USD, as anything less would be financially unsustainable for the project. However, we can offer the option of paying in two instalments for your convenience. Would that work for you?Kind regards,Tinashe - Zim Recordings","I am a little confused as 1. This email is from Justin Schlitman email name, but signed below byTinashe - Zim Recordings2. The voice on the recordings you emailed me earlier today is not quite the voice on the audition you posted on acx yesterday.Please explain.Angela"
